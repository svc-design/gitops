# Cloud-Neutral Toolkit GitOps

This repository is the **authoritative** GitOps declaration layer for the Cloud-Neutral Toolkit.

Consumers reference it by URL and ref rather than vendoring copies — for example the
`setup-iac-env` composite action in `platform-ops-toolkit`, which takes `gitops_repo_name`
and `gitops_repo_ref` as inputs. Declarations live here; the pipelines that act on them
live in their own repositories and pin the ref they consume.

## Scope

**In scope — declarative state:**

- Kubernetes resources and Flux Kustomizations.
- Non-sensitive multi-environment values.
- **IaC topology declarations**: the desired set of hosts, their sizes, groups, and service
  domains per environment. These are inputs consumed by Terraform renderers and by CMDB /
  inventory generators.

**Out of scope:**

- Application charts and Helm templates — these belong in the dedicated chart repository.
- Imperative automation: Ansible playbooks, roles, and hand-maintained inventories.
- Secrets of any kind. Credentials are distributed at runtime through Vault, never committed
  here. Topology declarations may contain SSH **public** keys; nothing private.

### On topology declarations specifically

A topology declaration states *what should exist* — it is data, not automation. That it is
later rendered into Terraform HCL, or into an Ansible inventory, does not make it imperative
automation, and does not conflict with the exclusion above. The line is:

| | Belongs here | Belongs to the pipeline repo |
|---|---|---|
| Host list, plan, groups, service domains | ✅ declaration | |
| The renderer that turns it into HCL | | ✅ |
| The generated `cmdb.json` / `inventory.ini` | | ✅ (build artifact) |
| Playbooks and roles that configure the hosts | | ✅ |

Generated inventories remain out of scope. The *declaration they are generated from* is in
scope.

### Serverless edge routing config backend

Non-sensitive Cloudflare/Cloud Run/VPS routing for the web-saas domain is declared as three
mode-specific `EdgeRoutingConfig` documents under
`topology/<env>/<mode>/runtime-topology.yaml`, where `<mode>` is exactly `selfhost`,
`serverless`, or `hybrid`. The orchestrator selects the document that matches its
responsibility; it must not reinterpret one mode's declaration as another mode. These files
are complete runtime-topology pre-configurations, not runtime secrets or deployment scripts.
The mode directory is deliberately not nested under a provider directory: the declaration
covers the complete runtime topology, not only Cloudflare resources.

The serverless and hybrid orchestrators check out the selected GitOps ref and pass the matching
file to the portal and edge-gateway deployers; those repositories do not own environment
hostnames or Worker names. Keep tokens, passwords, JWT secrets, and database connection strings
in Vault. The declarations may describe public origins and the primary/fallback routing policy.

## Layout

- `environments/`: cluster-level overlays and entrypoints (`clusters/<env>/`)
- `services/`: per-service declarations shared across environments
- `topology/`: cross-service runtime topology declarations (`<env>/<mode>/`)
- `resources/`: IaC topology declarations, keyed `<project>/<env>/<provider>/`
- `skills/`: repository-scoped conventions consumed by agents
- `docs/`: repository conventions and operational documentation

For a directory-level overview, see [docs/repo-structure.md](docs/repo-structure.md).

### `resources/` path convention

```
resources/<project>/<env>/<provider>/<declaration>.yaml
```

This shape accommodates the two conventions already in use:

| Consumer | Path |
|---|---|
| Multi-cloud account/resource matrices | `resources/svc.plus/uat/aws/account/bootstrap.yaml` |
| Vultr VPS topology per business domain | `resources/svc.plus/uat/vultr/web-saas.yaml` |

`<project>` is the domain base or account grouping, `<env>` is `sit` / `uat` / `prod`, and
`<provider>` is the cloud the declaration targets. Keeping the provider in the path is what
lets one environment span more than one cloud without the filenames colliding.

**Do not hardcode environment-varying values inside a declaration.** Domains, hostnames and
plans are supplied by the consuming pipeline (e.g. `TARGET_DOMAIN_BASE`, `INSTANCE_PLAN_API`).
A per-file fallback default is worse than none: divergent fallbacks render output that is
valid, plausible, and wrong in only some files.

The rule above applies to the topology declarations under `resources/.../<provider>/`.
The serverless `EdgeRoutingConfig` described below is an explicit environment-scoped
configuration backend: its selected environment domains and routing targets are intentional
desired state, not renderer fallback defaults.

`resources/svc.plus/prod/aws/github-actions-oidc.json` is the non-secret production
declaration for the AWS GitHub Actions OIDC provider, role ARN, and the permitted
`platform-ops-toolkit` branch/tag subjects. Both the Terraform bootstrap identity module and
the selfhost orchestrator consume this file. Do not put AWS keys, GitHub App keys, or Vault
tokens in this declaration.

## Consuming this repository

Pin a ref. A consumer that tracks a moving branch inherits every change here at the moment it
runs, which is rarely what a deployment wants:

```yaml
- uses: ./.github/actions/setup-iac-env
  with:
    gitops_repo_name: https://github.com/ai-workspace-infra/gitops.git
    gitops_repo_ref: ${{ inputs.gitops_repo_ref || 'main' }}
    gitops_target_path: gitops
```

**A missing declaration must fail the consuming step.** Reading a path that does not exist and
continuing — logging a warning and exiting 0 — produces a run that is green while having
configured nothing. Consumers are responsible for asserting that the declaration they expected
was actually found.
